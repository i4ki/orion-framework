     * [r1561] started to add chapter 2 of the book
     * [r1562] Updated 2 test cases to outline two major issues with the new hydration (at least i think that it has to do with the problems):
	  1) When the result set is in a custom order, components may be doubled (this already occured half a year ago though the symptoms were different (items were assigned to the wrong collection).
	  2) Accessing related components that are already loaded (but empty) results in lots of extra queries. The only way to get around that is do wrap an isset() check around nearly all places
	  before accessing a relation. This was not the case in earlier revisions though at that time an isset() was sometimes needed, too to prevent extra queries. But now it seems to be necessary
	  everywhere.
     * [r1563] finished converting chapter 2 to docbook

	  after my last commit i did some research in the php/pdo documentation and found that the port (well even the dsn) syntax depends a lot on the driver.
	  so my last 'fix' did fix it for mysql - but broke it for dblib/mssql, this patch should make it work with those aswell (just moved jonwages solution to a own case for dblib & mssql driver).
	  Someone should check if it works with the other drivers (i dont have all those database systems) cause looking at the doc
	  did show some more diffrences. (PHP Documentation for example says the dsn for pgsql needs to be delimited by spaces instead of semi-colons)

     * [r3182] fixes #596. Added suggested patch
     * [r3183] Refactoring. Started to introduced a clear separation between column names and field names (aka column aliases).\nDoctrine_Connection, DQL Parser classes/methods map field names =>
	  column names.\nDoctrine_Hydrate maps column names => field names during hydration.\nColumn names are only stored in Doctrine_Table:: and Doctrine_Table::.\nRelations use column names in
	  'local'/'foreign'.\nWhen using field names (column aliases) you need to use the column names in 'local'/'foreign' when setting up a relation (hasOne/hasMany), not the field names.\n\n In
	  other words column names are only used to communicate with the database. field names are used everywhere else. the casing of field names does not matter. column names are forced to lower
	  case for portability. If you dont use field names (column aliases) your column names are your field names (and therefore all lowercase).

     * [r3195] Introduced a separation of the 2 concerns: 1) Query construction 2) Result hydration.
	  Makes it easier to see the dependencies between these two concerns, cache the results of the query parsing process later on, implement & use alternative hydrators to experiment with
	  different algorithms etc. etc.
	  Other small refactorings.
     * [r3196]

     * [r3204] Added isValidModelClass() static method and fixed getLoadedModels() in order to resort back to the (classical) approach of class inclusion as a fallback when record classes have

     * [r4087] Fixed #749.
     * [r4089] Fixed #838. After reviewing the testcase, i've come to the conclusion that the desired use is invalid because it would basically allow having 2 root nodes in the tree (even if its
	  temporarily) and would therefore allow an invalid state / corrupt tree. I modified the testcase to reflect how it *could* be done, but that only works well when the old root does not yet
	  have any children. There are several solutions though: You can use a multi-root setup, in which case the desired action would be absolutely lega. Or you can use a single-root tree, but have
	  the real root as a dummy root that never changes and have a second node as the only child which is your root then. And there may be even more options, depending on your particular use-case.

     * [r4488] Fixes 1116. Actually it is a PHP bug that was only solved in 6 march 2008. So only possible release to have this fixed is using PHP 5.2.6. Please refer to
	  http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40417 for more explanation. I updated the test case to be sure we are correctly passing things to MySQL. Updated Query and QueryAbstract to use getParams as
	  they should. Also, getParams only displays the correct number of params after preQuery event. SoftDelete binds new values only after processing DQL (which is done calling getSql()), so
	  getParams only has the right values after it.
